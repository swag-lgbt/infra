# swagLGBT

[swagLGBT](https://swag.lgbt) is my own personal corner of the internet, my own slice of hell, my own whatever I want it to be. Right now, it's an awful lot of nothing, but eventually [it'll be more](#roadmap). This repository, in which you are reading this README, is the open-source (well, not totally open, see [LICENSE](./LICENSE)) code powering just about everything running in the swagLGBT universe.

## What is this?

I've been lucky enough to have been involved in a few different online communities over the years. These sorts of places typically consist of a chat platform like Discord or IRC, a small dedicated forum, and maybe an RTMP server or a wiki or what have you. Small, tight-knit communities like these were godsends to me when I first came out as transgender and didn't know any other trans people in real life, and during the COVID-19 lockdowns in the U.S. where I wasn't able to socialize IRL.

While it was fantastic being able to participate in these spaces curated by other people, eventually one thing or another would happen and some sort of drama would chase me out -- a hallmark of the "small online community" that seems to crop up in just about every space that has more than two members.

So I thought I'd make my own. Welcome!

## Contributing

Contributions are sort of welcome -- this is not really a traditional open-source project, it's actually more like my baby. It's a personal suite of applications where I get to do what I want -- but what I want is to share it with my friends, so if you're gonna be friendly, you're more than welcome to contribute (:

You can find the [contribution guidelines](/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md), a ["getting started" guide](/docs/Getting%20Started.md), and more helpful information for working on this codebase in the [/docs](/docs) folder.

## Roadmap

I have big dreams, and I'd eventually like to host a bunch of different stuff under the swagLGBT umbrella. Here's a rough list of things I want to get working, in approximate order:

- [ ] SSO for swagLGBT apps
- [ ] Observability dashboard (like [Grafana](https://grafana.com/))
- [ ] Chat server powered by Matrix
- [ ] TURN & STUN server integrated with chat
- [ ] Forum
- [ ] Shared component library / CSS library
- [ ] [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) API /  web app
- [ ] [Invidious](https://invidious.io/) instance
- [ ] Wiki
- [ ] [Plex media server](https://support.plex.tv/articles/200288286-what-is-plex/)
